# Vision Transformer for High-Precision Classification of Cancer Cell Cultures

This repository contains code and data for our research on using Vision Transformers (ViT) and CNNs to classify phase-contrast microscopy images of two cancer cell lines: **MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer)** and **PC3 (prostate cancer)**.

## üìå Abstract

Accurate classification of cancer cell morphology is critical for biomedical research and diagnostics. In this project, we investigate the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures to classify microscopy images of MDA-MB-231 and PC3 cell cultures under various growth conditions. A dataset was developed by segmenting individual cells and augmenting them across nine morphological classes. Our experiments show that transformer-based models outperform conventional CNNs in both accuracy and generalization.
